# KanbanDB App
My findings based on the KanbanDB Template challenge:
1. **updateCard** & **deleteCard** Functions under KanbanDB Public API need to be updated to **updateCardById** & **deleteCardById**.
2. **Snackbar Notification Card** has been added to provide additional flair while making updates to the cards.
3. **BONUS:** Editing, updating & saving existing card functionality has been added as well.
4. **Drag & Drop** Functionality works seamlessly for all statuses. {Package used: *react-draggable*}
